# Course Mod

## Description
A mod for the game [“A Dance of Fire and Ice”](https://store.steampowered.com/app/977950/A_Dance_of_Fire_and_Ice/).

This project supports playing & editing player-made “course”.
There are various features to help players build a course, release them,
and even allow other mod developers to arbitrarily open any courses.

More of that on the [wiki](https://github.com/ADOFAI-gg/CourseMod/wiki).
